# Difference betwwen Interface and Abstract Class

- The main difference between interface and abstract class in Java is that you can not create a non-abstract method in an interface, every method in an interface is by default abstract, but you can create a non-abstract method in abstract class. Even a class which doesn't contain any abstract method can be made abstract by using the abstract keyword
- The second difference between abstract class vs interface in Java is that interface is better suited for Type declaration and abstract class is more suited for code reuse and evolution perspective.
