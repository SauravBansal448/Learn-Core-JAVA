# Learn Class and Object in JAVA

## Class
    
   *Class is a user-defined blueprint or prototype of any object and define working flow of an object.
    Object can be a building, mobile phones etc.*
    
**For Example: **

```
 class Abc{ // Here 'Abc' is a Class Name
  
  int x;   // x is a Instance Variable
  
 }
 
```

## Object

 *Object is a real life entity. It have state, Behavior and Identity.*
 
**State**: It is represented by **attributes of an object and properties of an object.**

**Behavior**: It is represented by **methods of an object and response of an object with other objects.**

**Identity**: It gives a **unique name** to an object and enables one object to interact with other objects.


**For Example: **

`Abc object = new Abc();`

- **object** is a **refrence** variable.
- **Abc()** is a **Constructor**.
- **new** is a keyword in java and is used to provide some space in heap or consumes the space in heap.


#### Note:

- When an object of a class is created, the class is said to be **instantiated**. 
- All the instances share the attributes and the behavior of the class.
- default constructor gives the actual memory of an object in heap.
- to create an object of any class, It requires a **main method** because the execution of the code it starts from main.
